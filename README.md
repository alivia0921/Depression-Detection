# depression_detection
Detect depression related posts on Instagram profiles.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

The AI gathers captions and images from the user's personal Instagram profile through Instagram's private API. The Google cloud dataset supports the captions and pictures analysis and the app reports whether approximately half of the user's pictures are depressive. The app also generates the captions sentiment analysis results.
